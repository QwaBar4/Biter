# Biter

Biter is a Python bot that collects user phone numbers through Telegram with one-tap approval and stores them securely.

## Features 

- **One-tap phone sharing** - Users approve with a single button
- **Secure storage** - Saves data to `user_data.txt`
- **Real-time console output** - See collected numbers immediately

## How It Works 

1. User sends `/start` command
2. Bot shows approval button
3. User taps button once to share contact
4. Bot saves data to file and console:
